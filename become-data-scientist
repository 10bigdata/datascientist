10 Skills To Become a Data Scientist/Information Analyst

A Data Scientist or a Data Analyst (sometimes also called a Data Engineer) needs to possess an excellent understanding of both engineering and data. A love of mathematics and numbers will not hurt either. However, the function is still quite extensive and as a Data Scientist will really be based on the business, everything you do you work for and their information needs.
So below are the top 10 skills for a Data Scientist, that a data scientist should have which was orginally written on <a href="http://bigdatasciencetraining.com/">Data Science Courses</a>. So let's Start with the skills of a Data Scientist.
Know how to set the data up infrastructure
Know make and the way to supply data analysis information visualizations
Familiarity with big data applications (like Hive or Pig)
Expertise with statistical programming languages (like Python or R)
Being comfortable with mathematics (like calculus linear algebra and chance)
An excellent comprehension of statistics (like hypothesis testing and summary statistics)
An understanding of machine learning tools and techniques
Understanding of data wrangling or information munging and the tools that are associated
Software engineering skills (like distributed computing, algorithms and data structures)
At first sight, all of this might seem somewhat overwhelming, but think of it as a journey and do not believe which you need to learn this all at once.
